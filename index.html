Traits that you have that I like about you

        <img src="Angry.jpg" width="200px" height="200px"></a>
        <h3> When You Are Angry </h3>
    </center>
    <p>
       Now I know that this might be a strange trait that I enjoy about you but whenever you are mad at me it is only because you care about me.
        You only get mad because you are trying to make me a better person in general and for me to have a better career.
    </p>

<div class="traits">
<center>
<img src="Thoughtful.jpg" width="200px" height="200px"></a>
<h3> When You are Thoughtful </h3>
</center>
<p> 
    I like when you are Thoughtful because you show that you care about us but you do this without telling us.
    Even when you are tired you always think of some ideas to make us happy. 
</p>
</div>
<div class="traits">
<center>
<img src="respect.jpg" width="200px" height="200px"></a>
<h3> When You are Respectful </h3>
</center>
<p>
    I like when you give respect to us because you show that even though we are kids you treat everyone equally as one and not different even though we are kids.
    I also like when you listen to our ideas and judge them as if we are respected adults.
</p>
</div>
<div class="traits">
    <center>
    <img src="loyal.jpg" width="200px" height="200px"></a>
    <h3> When You are Loyal </h3>
    </center>
    <p>
        I like when you are loyal because if there is something between us we keep the stuff between ourselves only and we don't tell anyone else unless required to do so.
        </p>
    </div>

       
    <div class="traits">
        <center>

            <h3> When You are Kind </h3>
        </center>
        <p>
        I like when you are kind because you show affectionate feelings for us which makes me feel happy.
            When you are kind you always show great natural feelings.
        </div>
        <div class="traits">
            <center>

                <h3> When You are a Leader </h3>
            </center>
            <p>
            I like when you are a leader because you show how to solve problems and you lead our family into a righteous path.
            I also like when you are a leader because I aspire to be a leader as well to lead a company into being a great company.
